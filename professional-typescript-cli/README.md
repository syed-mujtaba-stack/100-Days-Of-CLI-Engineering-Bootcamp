# Professional TypeScript CLI 🟦
### Days 31-60 – Enterprise-Grade Command-Line Applications

This phase elevates CLI development from basic JavaScript to **professional TypeScript applications** with enterprise-grade architecture, type safety, and scalable design patterns. Each day builds sophisticated tools that demonstrate TypeScript's power in building robust, maintainable command-line software.

**Focus:** Type safety • Object-oriented programming • Scalable architecture • Enterprise patterns

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### TypeScript Fundamentals
- **Type System:** Advanced types, generics, utility types, and conditional types
- **Interfaces & Classes:** Strong typing for complex data structures and APIs
- **Modules & Namespaces:** Organizing large-scale applications with proper boundaries
- **Decorators & Metadata:** Building extensible and configurable systems

### Object-Oriented Programming
- **Design Patterns:** Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Observer, and Command patterns
- **Inheritance & Composition:** Building reusable and extensible component hierarchies
- **Encapsulation & Abstraction:** Creating clean APIs and hiding implementation details
- **Polymorphism:** Flexible systems that adapt to different data types and requirements

### Scalable CLI Architecture
- **Dependency Injection:** Building loosely coupled, testable applications
- **Plugin Systems:** Extensible architectures with dynamic module loading
- **Configuration Management:** Complex configuration with validation and type safety
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error management with custom error types and recovery
